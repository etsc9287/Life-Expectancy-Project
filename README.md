# Building an Economic Model For Life Expectancy

By Ethan Schacht

## Introduction

Many economic models are used to determine a nation's overall wealth, a concept that makes practical sense as the citizens of wealthier countries are more likely to live longer, more prosperous lives as a result of being able to afford more goods and services.  However, is a country's average wealth per person the only metric to determine the "well-being" of that nation? In this analysis, I will use a variety of economic factors to predict life expectancy of countries in 2019 to determine how these factors directly effect a measure of well-being rather than average wealth.  The purpose of this analysis is to draw attention to factors that play a role in raising life expectancy, specifically in countries that have low life expectancies considering their amount of wealth such as the United States.
